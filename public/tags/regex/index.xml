      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my video about &lt;a href=&#34;https://arkalim.org/blog/aws-saa-certification/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How I cleared the AWS SAA Certification Exam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I shared my preparation strategy as well as tips to ace the exam. I also gave a glimpse of my revision notes that I prepared while taking the course and practice exams on Udemy. After that video was out, I got so many comments and DMs, requesting me to share my notes, but the problem was that I took these notes using a note-taking app called Obsidian which stores them in markdown format locally on my Mac. Once I&amp;rsquo;m done editing my notes, I push them to a GitHub repository to make sure I don&amp;rsquo;t lose them if my laptop breaks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
